QUESTIONS:

1. Identify the player with the best batting average (total runs scored divided by the number of matches played) across all matches.
2. Find the team with the highest win percentage in matches played across all locations.
3. Identify the player who contributed the highest percentage of their team's total runs in any single match.
4. Determine the most consistent player, defined as the one with the smallest standard deviation of runs scored across matches.
5. Find all matches where the combined total of runs scored, wickets taken, and catches exceeded 500.
6. Identify the player who has won the most "Player of the Match" awards (highest runs scored or wickets taken in a match).
7. Determine the team that has the most diverse player roles in their squad.
8. Identify matches where the runs scored by both teams were unequal and sort them by the smallest difference in total runs between the two teams.
9. Find players who contributed (batted, bowled, or fielded) in every match that their team participated in.
10. Identify the match with the closest margin of victory, based on runs scored by both teams.
11. Calculate the total runs scored by each team across all matches.
12. List matches where the total wickets taken by the winning team exceeded 2.
13. Retrieve the top 5 matches with the highest individual scores by any player.
14. Identify all bowlers who have taken at least 5 wickets across all matches.
15. Find the total number of catches taken by players from the team that won each match.
16.  Identify the player with the highest combined impact score in all matches.
The impact score is calculated as:

Runs scored × 1.5 + Wickets taken × 25 + Catches × 10 + Stumpings × 15 + Run outs × 10.
Only include players who participated in at least 3 matches.
17.
Find the match where the winning team had the narrowest margin of victory based on total runs scored by both teams.
If multiple matches have the same margin, list all of them.
18.
List all players who have outperformed their teammates in terms of total runs scored in more than half the matches they played.
This requires finding matches where a player scored the most runs among their teammates and calculating the percentage.
19.
Rank players by their average impact per match, considering only those who played at least three matches.
The impact is calculated as:

Runs scored × 1.5 + Wickets taken × 25 + Catches × 10 + Stumpings × 15 + Run outs × 10.
Players with the same average impact should share the same rank.

20.
Identify the top 3 matches with the highest cumulative total runs scored by both teams.
Rank the matches based on total runs using window functions. If multiple matches have the same total runs, they should share the same rank.

21.
For each player, calculate their running cumulative impact score across all matches they’ve played, ordered by match date.
Include only players who have played in at least 3 matches.
